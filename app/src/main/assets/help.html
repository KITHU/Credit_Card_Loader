<p>when you open the app for the first time it may fail to detect anything since some files may not be downloaded to your phone by google play.
These files are downloaded automatically if there is data connection at the time of installation.

<p>If you click the <b>rectangle</b> with the credit card numbers selected by you phone, this can either be <b>safaricom</b> or <b>airtel</b> credit, your phone will automatically open phone dialer to select line to send to.</p>
